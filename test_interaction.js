// Test script to demonstrate quality assessment feature
const testTranscript = `I had a great meeting with Dr. Sarah Johnson yesterday at the Faculty Club. She's the new Dean of Engineering and seems very passionate about student success. We discussed the new engineering building project and she expressed strong interest in supporting it. 

She mentioned that her company, TechCorp, has been very successful this year and she's looking for meaningful ways to give back to the university. She specifically mentioned being interested in scholarships for first-generation college students since she was one herself.

We talked about her background - she grew up in a small town in Ohio and was the first in her family to go to college. She credits the university with changing her life trajectory. She now serves on several tech company boards and mentioned that she's particularly interested in supporting women in engineering programs.

I explained our current capital campaign goals and she seemed very engaged. She asked thoughtful questions about the timeline, naming opportunities, and impact metrics. She mentioned that she typically makes decisions about major gifts in consultation with her financial advisor and suggested we schedule a follow-up meeting in two weeks.

Her contact information is sarah.johnson@techcorp.com and her cell is 555-0123. I should follow up with the engineering building case statement and scholarship fund information she requested.

She seems like a great prospect for a six-figure gift to the engineering building, possibly in the $250,000-$500,000 range based on her company's success and her personal connection to the university.`;
